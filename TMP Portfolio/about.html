I have a Bacholor of Arts in History and am currently finishing a Master of Arts Degree in Public History with a concentration in Museum Studies. As a result my work history includes the fields of education and museum studies. I have experience as a private school teacher (2nd & 3rd grade), I also have extensive experience as a Substitute Teacher for both Atlanta and Gwinnett County public schools (primarily middle and high school). In addition to this, prior to the pandemic I obtained a 100-hour TEFL certificate via a training course in Madrid, Spain which specialized in tutoring adults as well as children.</p>
