        <p align="center">Technology has always fascinated me. At one time, I thought I would pursue
            a career as an animator. Over time, I took several detours and during the pandemic decided to 
            alter my career journey to align with my passions. As a result I am currently an entry level IT specialist 
            for a company. Although my educational backround is predominately involved in the liberal arts, I can see myself
            applying the coding strategies I'm learning to several areas of my life. I would like to continue learning about how 
            to create applications, especially those pertaining to education.
